🙋‍♀️ _Hi, friend! Pleased to meet you._ 

Chances are, I've either directed you here or you've been looking through my GitHub repos: in which case, welcome! Take a look around, read through my principles (listed below 👇), and [let me know if you have any questions](mailto:paige.bailey@microsoft.com). 

Looking forward to working with you!

### ⌚ My Hours

* I prefer to _work from home_, but love serendipitous hallway conversations + getting to know my coworkers. My ideal work week would have 3 - 4 days in the office, and 1 - 2 days working from home, or from a coworking space.

* Speaking of coworking spaces: **let me know** if you'd like to explore a new one, or if you have recommendations! I will spend at least a couple hours in one in each city I travel to. Some favorites:

> * [HanaHaus](http://www.hanahaus.com/) - _Palo Alto, CA_
> * [Microsoft Reactor](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/) - _many locations_
> * [Capital Factory](https://www.capitalfactory.com/) - _Austin, TX_
> * [Caroline Collective](https://www.houstonpress.com/arts/caroline-collective-is-officially-closed-6390605) - _Houston, TX; now closed._

### 🗺 Location

I am currently based in **Bellevue, WA**, just north of downtown - and have mapped every coffee shop within a two mile radius. Let me know if you're in the area, and [let's caffeinate]()! ☕

### 📞 Contact

I am available via **text message**, **email**, and [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/dynamicwebpaige) at all times - sans plane rides and sleeping hours. I will respond to all of the above within 5 minutes of receipt, if urgent. Always feel free to text me if you need something and I have given you my number.

My email response times are extremely right-skewed, and look a bit like this (x-axis = days):
